When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When one want to edit or create one file in other computer or when one is just a collaborator of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the automatically mode can send informations that the developer do not want to send, for some reason.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: allows to make contribuitions to a original branch that do not belongs to you.
    Clones: allows to make a copy of a branch.
    Branches: are the divisions that can be online or offline, depend of the location of your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Organization and supervision.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be very hard to work with colaborators without using git or github. Some softwares/apps have some itens that help to identify the changes that are made and who make those changes, but it doesn't compare to git or github

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When are collaborators working together in the same part of a project. This method help to make the changes clean and avoid some errors that could be done in the way. This improves organization and supervision in the project, allowing to perform a better version of it.
